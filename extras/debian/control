Description: geographic objects support for PostgreSQL
 PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the 
 PostgreSQL object-relational database. In effect, 
 PostGIS "spatially enables" the PostgreSQL server, 
 allowing it to be used as a backend spatial database 
 for geographic information systems (GIS), much like 
 ESRI's SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS 
 follows the OpenGIS "Simple Features Specification 
 for SQL" and will be submitted for conformance 
 testing at version 1.0.
