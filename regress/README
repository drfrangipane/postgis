- Mixed-dimensioned geometries are no longer supported
  (previous behaviour was to fill Z with a 0 value)
  [ updated to use new behaviour ]

- geometry_same operator (=~) now requires all dimensions equality
  Previously only x/y were checked

- geometry_same operator (=~) now requires geom type equality
  Previous behaviour:
     GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(0 1), POINT(2 3)) =~  MULTIPOINT(0 1,2 3)

- numb_sub_geometries does not exist anymore
  [updated to use numgeometries]

- truly_inside does not exist anymore
  [updated to use within]
