- Clean up mapserver connectivity
- Submit to OpenGIS Consortium for testing
- Network creation and network operations 
  (upstream, downstream, least cost path)
- Standardized handling for topology and coverages with 
  support functions.
- casts between PostGIS and PostgreSQL geometry classes

======================================
2005/12/16 - PostGIS 1.1.0 closeup
======================================

- TEST TEST TEST (upgrades mainly)

- Remove type-punned warnings given by gcc-3.3 ?

======================================
2005/12/14 - other random items 
======================================

- Add findsrid() functions that find good carthesian projection
  srids for a given geometry.
  
- Treat geometries without SRID=-1 as compatible with all other
  geometries in geometry operations

- Special threatment of SRID=-1, dims=-1, type=GEOMETRY
  in geometry_columns

- LineMerge and Polygonize* interfaces for JTS

- More LRS functions

- Selectivity estimation code merge (+- pgsql-8.0.0)
	
- fix invalid stats computation (currently keeps the previously
  computed ones, should instead wipe them out - possibly a pgsql bug).

- MakeValidShape() to remove consecutive vertexes and any eventual
  other cleanup aimed at making pgsql2shp produce "valid" Shapefiles.
