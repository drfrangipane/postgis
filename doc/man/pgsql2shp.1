pgsql2shp - postgis to shapefile dumper
.SH "SYNTAX"
.LP 
pgsql2shp [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdatabase\fR [\fIschema\fR\fB.\fR]\fItable\fR
.br 
pgsql2shp [\fIoptions\fR] \fIdatabase\fR \fIquery\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The pgsql2shp table dumper connects directly to the database and converts a table (possibly created by user query) into a shape file. It is compatible with
all versions of PostGIS.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
The commandline options are:

.TP 
\fB\-f\fR <\fIfilename\fR>
Write the output to a particular filename.

.TP 
\fB\-h\fR <\fIhost\fR>
The database host to connect to.

.TP 
\fB\-p\fR <\fIport\fR>
The port to connect to on the database host.


.TP 
\fB\-P\fR <\fIpassword\fR>
The password to use when connecting to the database.


.TP 
\fB\-u\fR <\fIuser\fR>
The username to use when connecting to the database.

.TP 
\fB\-g\fR <\fIgeometry column\fR>
In the case of tables with multiple geometry columns, the geometry column to use when writing the shape file.

.TP 
\fB\-b\fR
Use a binary cursor. When used on pre\-1.0.0 PostGIS versions this will reduce the likelihood of coordinate drift due to conversion to and from WKT format. 
Coordinate drifts will not occur with PostGIS 1.0.0 and newer versions.
It will be slightly faster, but might fail if any NON\-gemetry column lacks
a cast to text.

.TP 
\fB\-r\fR
Raw mode. Do not drop the gid field, or escape column names.

.TP 
\fB\-d\fR
For backward compatibility: write a 3\-dimensional shape file when dumping from old (pre\-1.0.0) postgis databases (the default is to write a 2\-dimensional shape file in that case). Starting from postgis\-1.0.0+, dimensions are fully encoded. 

.TP 
\fB\-k\fR
Keep idendifiers case (don't uppercase field names).
