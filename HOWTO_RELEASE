How to release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Date: 2006-09-27

Versioning Scheme
-----------------

Release version is composed by REL_MAJOR_VERSION, REL_MINOR_VERSION
and REL_MICRO_VERSION components. "REL" here matches SO for the server
side of PostGIS, and JDBC for the java side.

By default only [REL_MICRO_VERSION] increments between releases.

[REL_MINOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO set to 0) when minor
additions have been introduced (one or two functions can be considered
*micro* additions)

[REL_MAJOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO and MINOR set to 0) when
a dump/reload of existing spatial databases is *REQUIRED* for things
to work or rather *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* to get new functionalities.

Release procedure

1) Update Version.config as specified in Versioning Scheme above.
