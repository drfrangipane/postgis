How to release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Date: 2005-12-15

Versioning Scheme
-----------------

Release version is composed by REL_MAJOR_VERSION, REL_MINOR_VERSION
and REL_MICRO_VERSION components.

By default only [REL_MICRO_VERSION] increments between releases.

[REL_MINOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO set to 0) when minor
additions have been introduced (one or two functions can be considered
*micro* additions)

[REL_MAJOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO and MINOR set to 0) when
a dump/reload of existing spatial databases is *REQUIRED* for things
to work or rather *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* to get new functionalities.
